let obj: any = { x: 0 };
// None of the following lines of code will throw compiler errors.
// Using `any` disables all further type checking, and it is assumed 
// you know the environment better than TypeScript.
obj.foo();

const n: number = obj;

// The any type is useful when you donâ€™t want to write out a long type just to convince TypeScript that a particular line of code is okay.
