/*
Other than the standard type annotations, TypeScript doesnâ€™t add anything else new to methods.

Note that inside a method body, it is still mandatory to access fields and other methods via this.. 
An unqualified name in a method body will always refer to something in the enclosing scope:
*/

let x: number = 0;
 
class C {
  x: string = "hello";
 
  m() {
    // This is trying to modify 'x' from line 1, not the class property
    x = "world";
    // Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
  }
}
